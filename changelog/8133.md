### Added

- add new django setting APLUS_MANUAL_URL which contains a link to a manual. The
  link will get the language code + ":start" appended to account for the user
  language. If something else then dokuwiki as a target is used this needs to be
  changed in the template.
- add Help menu item to user indicator which opens the url set with
  APLUS_MANUAL_URL in a new tab
